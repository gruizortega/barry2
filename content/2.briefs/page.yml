Because written advocacy is the most important part of an appellate attorney's work, a potential client should always review an appellate attorney's written work product. Please click on the links below in order to see some representative appellate briefs I have written. I do not post briefs from cases that have not yet been decided, so very recent briefs are not posted.

Other briefs are available on request.

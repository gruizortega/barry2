		<h3>About Me</h3>
		
		<img class="portrait" src="img/photo.jpg" alt="portrait" />
		<p>I have practiced appellate law for more than 20 years.  I began practicing appellate law with a firm that specializes in this area.  After approximately 10 years with that firm, I left to start my own practice. 
I graduated from Georgetown University Law Center and am licensed in the District of Columbia and Virginia, as well as in California.  I have also been admitted to several federal court bars, including the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (which hears appeals from California federal courts) and the United States Supreme Court.  I am a member of the Los Angeles County Bar Association.</p>
		<p>I have received awards for pro bono work from the Anti-Defamation League and the Los Angeles Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>
		
		
		<h3>About My Practice</h3>
		<p>I represent clients only in civil appellate litigation, although I will consult with attorneys regarding matters that may arise in earlier stages of litigation, including dispositive motions, evidentiary issues, jury instructions, verdict forms and post-trial matters.</p>
		<p>Most of my work involves employment law, particularly discrimination cases.  I also represent clients in appellate cases involving contracts, real property, family law, personal injuries, decedent's estates and appeals from administrative proceedings. I represent both plaintiffs and defendants except in employment law matters, in which I generally represent plaintiffs.</p>
		<p>I take only cases that I think have legal merit.  I never accept a case simply to earn a fee.  Once I am retained by a client, I make sure I have sufficient time to devote to that client's appeal even if it means turning away other work.  I attempt to provide the best representation possible in order to maximize my client's chances of winning or securing a favorable settlement.</p>

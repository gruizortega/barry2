		<h3>Representative Appellate Briefs</h3>
		
		<p>Because written advocacy is the most important part of an appellate attorney's work, a potential client should always review an appellate attorney's written work product. Please click on the links below in order to see some representative appellate briefs I have written.   I do not post briefs from cases that have not yet been decided, so my most recent briefs are not posted.</p>
		<p>Other briefs are available on request.</p>
